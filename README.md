## How does the Nirmata CLI (nctl) help?
Integrating Nirmata CLI (`nctl`) into the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline ensures rapid identification of misconfigurations in Kubernetes manifests, Dockerfiles, and Terraform files, preempting potential issues before they escalate. This proactive approach enhances the reliability and security of deployments, ultimately accelerating the time-to-market for software releases.
