## How does the Nirmata CLI (nctl) help?
Integrating Nirmata CLI (`nctl`) into the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline ensures rapid identification of misconfigurations in Kubernetes manifests, Dockerfiles, and Terraform files, preempting potential issues before they escalate. By providing automated remediations, it streamlines the process of fixing vulnerabilities, thereby reducing delays and ensuring a smoother path to production. This proactive approach enhances the reliability and security of deployments, ultimately accelerating the time-to-market for software releases.
